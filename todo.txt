Todo file for dropsync:

1 - do first real run on windows desktop
   - create sda-windows.conf for windows (sender) machine
   - create sda-timdesk.conf for timdesk (receiver) machine
 - support partitioning files (for files larger than size limit)
   - on sender: when making transfer file:
     - if file is bigger than transfer_file_size_limit, then:
       - create multiple partition files in source_dir, and restart (?)
         - don't re-create existing files with name .partyyofxx
   - on receiver: after processing transfer files,
     - if files end in .partyyofxx,
       - if there's a file with yy==xx, 
         - find ones with same leading name,
         - combine them into one file
 - avoid errors based on incorrect -r or -s line:
   - have source_dir be empty on receiver and dest_dir be empty on sender
 - set up for periodic execution (crontab?, windows something?)
 - do incremental update of index file
   - have a "quick" index update
     - read index
     - scan for date/size mismatch in filesystem
       - update sha1 on mismatch
   - scan for missing files
   - scan for new files
 - change name to syncdir-amp (for sync_dir amplifier)
 - show progress of operation
   - assume 1000 files-per-minute indexing, and give time estimate
   - measure file copy time, and give time estimate
 - if sha1 is OK but other attributes are not, only send entry_line
   - don't send the content, and mark this as an attribute update only
 - write index as it is read
   - write directories with placeholder sha1, then fill in sha1 at end
     - write routine to find entry in index file 
     - write routine to update entry in index file
 - allow for specifying omitted dirs
 - allow for specifying omitted file patterns
 - use inotify to monitor directories for changes
   - monitor source_dir (sender)
   - monitor dest_dir (receiver)
   - monitor sync_dir (both)
 - support running directly from Windows (check that paths all work)
 - test using different OS for sender and receiver (e.g. Windows to Linux)
 - support sending transfer files by e-mail
 - use an option to specify 'delete in destination' (don't do it by default)
 - handle permissions correctly
 - add version option
 - send deltas instead of full files (lots of work!, but would save bandwidth)
 - keep path of indexed directory in index file
    (and sanity check before overwriting)
 - use atomic rename (after writing to a temp file) to avoid corrupted files on the destination
