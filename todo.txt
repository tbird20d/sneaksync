Todo file for dropsync:

= bugfixes blocking release

= other bugfixes
 - fix problem with violation of transfer_size_limit 
   - first batch of 442 files created, then another batch created again
   - is data not re-initializing properly when doing period looping??
   - is data.transfer_file_total_size getting reset to 0?

= other high-priority features =
 - put amount still outstanding in sender log
   - keep size_skipped, parts_skipped, deletes_skipped stats

== other features ==
 - support USB-stick mode:
   - auto-run on insertion of stick
     - see http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-flash-drive-that-copys-users-files-si/4/
     - add marker file to identify source dir on source machine

   - auto-detect sender or receiver mode
   - sync and unmount when transfer is complete
   - make a test config file for a USB stick

 - don't run receiver until transfer files have been synched to destination
   - detect transfer complete (how?- separate header and content??)
     - make a transfer list? (only receiver would check it, and it's not
        running)
       - would have list of all expected transfer files
       - receiver could defer running if transfer files haven't shown up yet
         - could check frequently and see if anything is changing in sync_dir
         - check for missing sequence numbers, and wait until they show up
          
     - OR, put content in separate file
       - don't process a transfer file until content size matches transfer

== nice-to-have ==
  - have 2 periods?
    - one for when we have files outstanding and one for when we don't
easy - get rid of -vv (it's too much?)
  - send more data even if dest_sequence doesn't change, if
	we skipped items, and there are no transfer files
     - ie use absence of transfer files to trigger sending more data
     - this allows overlapping dest_index update and new sends

easy - add areas to dprint()
   - add debug_list
   - add area to each dprint statement - (there are 66 dprints)
     - determine allowed areas
       - indexing, sha1, transfers, all
   - only print if debug == "all" or dprint area matches item in debug_list
 - put part_size in log header (config area)
 - read and write updates to index files directly in file instead of in memory
   - allows for arbitrarily large indexes
   - don't know if this scales well, adding a new entry at the beginning of
      the file requires pushing everything down (re-writing entire file)
     - leave space for new entries?
 - make standalone Windows executable - use py2exe
 - have an option for just comparing source and destination index, to
   report the current size of the difference between the two (how much is
   currently out-of-sync)
 - have period be from start of program, not end of operations
   - so if started at 8:00 am, then run would be 10:00 at (at period 120),
     instead of, say 10:13 (assuming a 13-minute run)
 - support multiple indices (sync-sets) in the same sync_dir
   - allow for specifying the index filename in the config
     - default to source_index and dest_index?
 - keep path of indexed directory in index file (why?)
    (and sanity check before overwriting)
 - avoid errors based on incorrect -r or -s line:
   - have source_dir be empty in receiver config and dest_dir be empty in
	sender config
 - change name to syncdir-amp (for sync_dir amplifier)
 - show progress of operation
   - assume 1000 files-per-minute indexing, and give time estimate
   - measure file copy time, and give time estimate
   - use terminal code to update index line every 2 seconds
     - find total number of files to index first, and give a yy of xx status?
 - show progress percentage (dup)
   - create work estimate
	- count of previous index lines?
	- count of in-memory index entries?
   - keep track of progress
	- lines of index written
   - write percentage
 - if sha1 is OK but other attributes are not, only send entry_line
   - don't send the content, and mark this as an attribute update only
 - use inotify to monitor directories for changes
   - monitor source_dir (sender)
   - monitor sync_dir (sender and receiver)
 - use an option to control 'delete in destination' (don't do it by default)
 - handle permissions correctly - do something with permissions
   - hard for cross-OS stuff (what to do with Windows perms?)
 - detect that root sha1 did not change after a receive (that processed
   transfer files), and do a full re-index without a cache
   - this is expensive, but is a last resort if something weird happens
   - get root sha1 from previous dest_index, compare to root sha1
   - do this in update_index??
   - just delete dest_index file and do update_index()
   - low priority, because can manually delete dest_index

== low-priority bugs ==
   - dropsync doesn't integrate the logs from each side
     - if sender and receiver are writing at the same time,
	confusion can result
   - don't process a transfer file if content size doesn't match
     entry size

== testing ==
 - support running directly from Windows (check that paths all work)
 - test using different OS for sender and receiver (e.g. Windows to Linux)
   - am using cygwin to Linux, but not Windows to Linux yet

== long-term ideas ==
 - support sending transfer files by e-mail
 - support initiating transfers when phone connects to specific networks
   - e.g. when connected to source network, run sender, and when connected
	to dest network, run receiver, automatically (phone is intermediary)
   - may need to get permission to launch actions on host
 - send deltas instead of full files (lots of work!, but would save bandwidth)
