Here is some information about efficiency and run times:

First run (version 0.4.0 or something):
 - 46 minutes to send
 - 126 minutes (2 hours) to receive
(see below)

This was before I implemented fast indexing (or logging)


---------
First run on Windows machine:
$ time sneaksync -i

real    46m15.417s
user    10m47.543s
sys     2m46.390s

First run on Linux machine:
$ time sneaksync -r -i

real	126m37.026s
user	10m1.154s
sys	1m54.139s

this only covered the "Pictures" directory, with about 50,000 files
The disk at work was USB (NOT on a USB 3.0 port)
